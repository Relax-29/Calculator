## Overview
In search for resources to better my front-end Journey, I discovered an amazing site that provides front-end developers with design files to replicate. This is one of the many solutions I have submitted so far. Do give me your feedbacks on how I can improve.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
